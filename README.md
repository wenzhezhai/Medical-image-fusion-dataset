# Medical-image-fusion-dataset

The registration of CT and MRI images are obtained from [the Whole Brain Atlas (AANLIB)](http://www.med.harvard.edu/aanlib/home.html) database of Harvard Medical School and other online sites [1](https://github.com/ashna111/multimodal-image-fusion-to-detect-brain-tumors), [2](https://sites.google.com/view/durgaprasadbavirisetti/datasets/). Among them, AANLIB is publicly accessible online. It mainly consists of brain images based on normal and pathological conditions. Normal brain images are 2D or 3D, while pathological images are further divided into subcortical diseases, including stroke, tumor, degenerative, infectious diseases, and many other brain-related diseases. We employ 50 pairs of CT and MRI scan images for the experiment. The training dataset contains 35 pairs of images and the test dataset includes 15 pairs of images.
